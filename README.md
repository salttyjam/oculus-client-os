# Oculus client OS
Hello! Recently, my VR headset broke, so i've been tinkering with the headset's os, reverting versions, etc. So, Iv'e created this version of the Oculus OS to make the headset actually good, because the new ui honestly feels sluggish and looks bad imo. So, have fun with this os!

WARNING:THIS CAN CAUSE BRICKING!!! I HAVE ONLY TESTED ON QUEST 2, so ONLY USE QUEST 2 IF YOU WANT TO TRY. THIS IS STILL IN BETA!!!
I cannot help if you need assitance from your hedset breaking. Honestly, if you want to try this, BE A NERD. IF YOU DONT KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE OCULUS THEN YOU CANT do this.
Sorry for the rant, also if Meta requests the project to be taken out of public use, I am ready to kill the project at a moments notice!
